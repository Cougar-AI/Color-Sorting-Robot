CougarAI's collaborative project with the Society of Women Engineers for a Color-Sorting Arduino Robotic Arm

By: Dylan Berens, Asheeyana Ahmed, TÃ¢m Phan, Kelley Greer, Bernadette de Lara, Bethia Alegado

Color detection was handled by a TCS3200, with the S2 and S3 pins' outputs being used to measure and classify the color of the objects to be sorted.

The project used an Arduino Nano, a breadboard, 3D printed parts for the robotic arm, claw and swivel, chopsticks, male-to-male, female-to-female and female-to-male electrical wiring, and we used the Arduino IDE for the ease of implementation of the written code.

Our Color-Sorting Arduino Robotic Arm won "People's Choice" for best project
